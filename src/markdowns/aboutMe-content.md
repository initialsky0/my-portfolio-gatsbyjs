### I am a Front-End Developer

Experienced with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React library. I have completed many course projects that mirror modern applications. These projects were tested and improved by adding functionalities to grant a better user experience. I can learn and adapt to new libraries and frameworks quickly by researching and reading documentations. While libraries and frameworks are usually quick solutions to problems, I like to invest time to think and code the solution myself for personal projects. It provides practice to improve my problem-solving skills and allow me to layout logic and motivate myself to discover new coding techniques and patterns. I am a great team player and am open to criticism. I am currently looking for a challenging position to enhance my coding knowledge.
